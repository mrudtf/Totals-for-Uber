            <h2>Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                When you authorize me to pull your data from Uber, I only have permission to basically view your profile / activity / history.
            </p>
            <p>
                I <strong>cannot</strong> request rides for you or do anything that would cost you money.
            </p>
            <p>
                The site uses cookies to know that you're you, and that it was you who authorized the Uber account access.
                A brief amount of data is also stored locally. Why? Basically for the leaderboard, and for making queries quicker.
            </p>
            <p>
                None of your data that I can access is as risk.
                You can watch me on <a href="https://twitter.com/bryceadams/">Twitter</a> to be sure, and email me at
                <strong>brycead [aaatttt sign] gmail (single dot) com</strong> to voice your concerns.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only other piece of data I have is your email. I may send you one or two emails at some point in the future that immediately concern this project
                or a related one. I won't spam you. Promise.
            </p>
            <p>
                But if you're actually concerned, it'd probably be best if you left the site/app right now.
